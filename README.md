* This repository holds python code that gathers precipitation and temperature data from stations in Hawaii and builds an API for which a user can interact with said data. <br>
* All the files here were completed for the SQL Alchemy challenge for the DU Data Analytics Bootcamp. <br>
* All of the data used was provided by edX, and I adapted the code provided by edX with the help of the Xpert Learning Assisstant.
