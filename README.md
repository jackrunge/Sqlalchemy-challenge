This repository holds python code that gathers precipitation and temperature data from stations in hawaii and builds an API for which a user can interact with said data.
All the files here were completed for the SQL Alchemy challenge for the DU Data Analytics Bootcamp.
All of the data used was provided by edX, and I adapted the code provided by edX with the help of the Xpert Learning Assisstant.
